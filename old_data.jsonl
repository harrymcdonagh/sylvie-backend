Taking breaks from everyone is important; it could be good to take some deep breaths on a walk by the UEA lake when you find yourself having conflict with others. If conflict and disagreement persist, remember UEA has a zero tolerance policy towards bullying. Reporting this to the SU may help resolve things.
